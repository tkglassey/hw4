Setting up the project: 1
This has a multitude of steps, involving setting up composer, changing the names, and probably setting up the project.

Getting Composer to work: 2
Just because everything is set up doesn't mean it works. I need to get the composer to actually do thing properly, which it doesn't want to to with MAMP...
I want to die from this step alone.

COMPOSER AUTOLOAD DOESN'T FUCKING WORK 10
FUCK THIS
FUCK YOU
FUCK IT
I HATE THIS FUCKING CLASS AND THESE FUCKING ASSIGNMENTS THAT NEVER WORK PROPERLY
FUCK MAKING WEBSITE I HOPE I NEVER DO THIS SHIT FOR THE REST OF MY GOD DAMN LIFE
I'M JUST GOING TO FUCKING DO EVERYTHING IN GOD DAMN HTML IN THE FUTURE

Composer Autoload 4
After being unable to ever get it to recognize namespaces with the psr-4, I gave up and decided to manually load every file. Because I'm not wasting 5 more
hours troubleshooting this stuff when technically nothing on the requirements says I have to do it like that.
