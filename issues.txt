Setting up the project: 1
This has a multitude of steps, involving setting up composer, changing the names, and probably setting up the project.

Getting Composer to work: 2
Just because everything is set up doesn't mean it works. I need to get the composer to actually do thing properly, which it doesn't want to to with MAMP...
I want to die from this step alone.

COMPOSER AUTOLOAD DOESN'T * WORK 10
* THIS
* YOU
* IT
I HATE THIS FUCKING CLASS AND THESE * ASSIGNMENTS THAT NEVER WORK PROPERLY
* MAKING WEBSITE I HOPE I NEVER DO THIS * FOR THE REST OF MY * LIFE
I'M JUST GOING TO FUCKING DO EVERYTHING IN * HTML IN THE FUTURE

Composer Autoload 4
After being unable to ever get it to recognize namespaces with the psr-4, I gave up and decided to manually load every file. Because I'm not wasting 5 more
hours troubleshooting this stuff when technically nothing on the requirements says I have to do it like that.
"autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "goldenFeathers\hw4\\": ["src/"]
        }
    }

Just make the damn website look proper 5
Screw organizing it properly, I don't care anymore. I'll take the few points. I tried organizing how it was wanted last time, got 5.5 points why suffer for the sake of 3 extra points.
